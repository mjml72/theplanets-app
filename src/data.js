        name: "MERCURY",
        overview: "Mercury the smallest planet in our solar system and nearest to the Sun is only slightly larger than Earth's Moon. Its surface is covered in tens of thousands of impact craters. From the surface of Mercury, the Sun would appear more than three times as large as it does when viewed from Earth, and the sunlight would be as much as 11 times brighter.",

        name: "MARS",

        structure: "Neptune is one of two ice giants in the outer solar system (the other is Uranus). Most (80% or more) of the planet's mass is made up of a hot dense fluid of icy materials water, methane, and ammonia above a small, rocky core. Of the giant planets, Neptune is the densest.",
